## Proposed Features for a Legal Simulation Game

# Immigration law cases (asylum, citizenship, deportation)

- Immigration cases typically involve issues related to visas, green cards, 
   and citizenship. 
   These cases may arise when an individual is seeking to enter the United States, 
   extend their stay, or obtain permanent resident status. Some common immigration cases include:

- Family-based immigration: Cases in which a U.S. citizen or 
permanent resident sponsors a family member for immigration.

- Employment-based immigration: Cases in which a U.S. 
employer sponsors a foreign worker for a work visa.

- Asylum: Cases in which an individual seeks protection 
from persecution in their home country.

- Deportation and removal: Cases in which an individual faces deportation 
or removal from the United States due to immigration violations.

- Naturalization: Cases in which an individual applies for U.S. citizenship.

- Consular processing: Cases in which an individual applies for 
a visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad.

- Adjustment of status: Cases in which an individual applies 
for a green card while in the United States.

- Visa waivers: Cases in which an individual seeks to enter 
the United States without a visa.

- Immigration cases can be complex and often involve navigating multiple 
federal agencies and regulations. 

# Historical

- The assassination of Julius Caesar: On March 15, 44 BC, Julius Caesar, the dictator of Rome, was assassinated by a group of senators who were opposed to his rule.

- The Salem Witch Trials: In the late 17th century, more than 200 people in Salem, Massachusetts, were accused of witchcraft and 20 were executed. The trials were a tragic example of mass hysteria and the dangers of religious fanaticism.
